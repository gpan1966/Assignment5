ASSIGNMENT 5

I have taken Anton's suggestion to create my own implementation to try and understand the concepts of moving data around.

As such, I have created my own project which demonstrates my understanding. Although I have not done the individual reminders (as it is Mother's day and have limited time) I have achieved all the main deliverables as defined in the assignment and I now understand the concepts as you will see in my submission.

Any comments welcome

Regards,
George
